            <h2>The 3 Essential Skills for Becoming Better at Anything</h2>
            <p>This is not a post about what you should or shouldn't do to get better at something, but rather, what you must and essentially do. I've identified 3 must-dos that anyone learning to build a skill that will last a lifetime must employ and those are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Dedicated and Focused Activity related to your Skill</li>
                <li>Consistency</li>
                <li>Voluntary Relaxation</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h3>Dedicated and Focused Activity related to your Skill</h3>
            <p>Simply, you need to practice your craft. For at least 1-4 hours each day. High-quality human cognition is a limited and scarce resource.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Consistency</h3>
            <p>The second point is Consistency. To illustrate this point, I like to think of it like the wavelength of a wave.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Voluntary Relaxation</h3>
            <p>The third and probably the most underrated and crucial, is Voluntary Relaxation. It's my experience that after you do an activity for 1-2 hours, you must schedule an appointment with yourself, where, depending on your energy level, you must either relax, meditate, take a nap, listen to soothing music, go out for a walk, or do anything that is less of a cognitive load than what you just experienced while doing your skill-related activity.</p>
